Using a fine-tuned DNABERT model and graph neural network in tandem, we aim to reveal key cis-regulatory elements, combinatorial action of transcription factors and histone modifications, and 3D chromatin interactions. We have formulated a classification task that will grant insight into the binding affinity and 3D organization of MREs on the X-chromosome. Importantly, MREs are not exclusive to the X-chromosome and are found globally. Our study aims to reveal the significant difference between the MREs on the X-chromosome, leading to its unique targeting. Furthermore, the power of our study lies in the interpretability of these models. Using sophisticated interpretability approaches for both transformers and GNNs, we may reveal novel cis-regulatory elements, combinations of TFs and histone modifications, and 3D chromatin interactions that assist in driving dosage compensation to the X-chromosome.

Below, we describe the schematic utilized in this project. Data utilized in the project was produced in house in the Larschan Lab at Brown University. All code for each module can be found in the respective module directories.
